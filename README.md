Create Tidal playlists based on [FIP](fip.fr) radio broadcasts.

This project queries the historical data for the tracks FIP played in the past
and creates Tidal playlists. I created this project because FIP streams in 128k
MP3 at most, and songs couldn't be skipped. I also didn't care for the news or
the talking.
